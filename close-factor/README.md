# Close Factors

From a discussion on facebook started by Dermot:

```
Hey, calling all proper maths nerds; A mate of mine just posted
this question and I are dumb, but I suspect M1 or one of his groupies
will know the answer pretty much off the top of their heads;

Math and scripting nerds, I need some help. I need to calculate the
two factors closest together (I had described this as the two largest
factors but Joy pointed out I was actually wrong in my description)
of a given, non-prime, number. I need to stop factoring there. For
instance, 24 would 6 and 4, 48 would be 6 and 8, 100 would be 10
and 10, and so on. For lack of a better description I need to find
the length and width of a rectangle, that's as close to a square
as possible, knowing only the area. If I could do this from using
bc from a bash shell that would be even better."
